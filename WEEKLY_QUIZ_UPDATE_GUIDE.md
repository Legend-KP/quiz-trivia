# üìù Weekly Quiz Update Guide

This guide shows you how to prepare and update questions for each weekly quiz (Tuesday & Friday).

---

## üìç Location: `src/lib/weeklyQuiz.ts`

All quiz questions are located in the `getCurrentWeeklyQuiz()` function, starting around **line 84**.

---

## üîÑ Update Process (Step-by-Step)

### **Step 1: Update the Topic**
Find line 88 and update the topic:

```typescript
topic: "Your New Topic Here", // Update this topic for each quiz
```

**Example Topics:**
- "DeFi Protocols"
- "Layer 2 Scaling Solutions"
- "NFT Standards & Use Cases"
- "Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)"
- "DAO Governance"
- "Web3 Security Best Practices"
- "Tokenomics Fundamentals"

---

### **Step 2: Update Questions Array**
Replace the `questions` array (lines 91-172) with your new questions.

---

## üìã Question Format Template

Each question follows this exact format:

```typescript
{
  id: 1,                                           // Question number (1-10)
  question: "Your question text here?",            // The question
  options: [                                        // 4 options (array)
    "Option A",
    "Option B", 
    "Option C",
    "Option D"
  ],
  correct: 0,                                      // Index of correct answer (0-3)
                                                   // 0 = first option, 1 = second, etc.
  timeLimit: 45,                                   // Always 45 seconds
  explanation: "Clear explanation of why this answer is correct." // Educational
},
```

---

## ‚úÖ Complete Example

Here's how a complete set of 10 questions looks:

```typescript
questions: [
  {
    id: 1,
    question: "What does TVL stand for in DeFi?",
    options: ["Total Value Locked", "Token Value Limit", "Trading Volume Limit", "Transaction Value Lock"],
    correct: 0,
    timeLimit: 45,
    explanation: "TVL measures the total value of assets locked in DeFi protocols, indicating protocol usage and liquidity."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Which DeFi protocol pioneered automated market making?",
    options: ["Compound", "Uniswap", "MakerDAO", "Aave"],
    correct: 1,
    timeLimit: 45,
    explanation: "Uniswap introduced the constant product formula (x*y=k) for automated market making in DeFi."
  },
  // ... continue for questions 3-10
]
```

---

## üéØ Important Rules

### ‚úÖ **DO:**

- Add clear, educational `explanation` text
- Use question marks (?) at the end of questions

### ‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Don't use more or less than 10 questions
- Don't change `timeLimit` (must be 45)
- Don't use wrong `correct` index (must match option position)
- Don't forget commas between questions

## üöÄ How to Prepare Questions (Workflow)

### **Option 1: Prepare in a Text File First**

1. Create a text file: `quiz_questions_[date].txt`
2. Write your questions in this format:

```
Topic: Layer 2 Scaling Solutions

Q1: What is the primary benefit of Layer 2 solutions?
A) Lower transaction costs
B) Higher transaction costs  
C) More centralization
D) Slower transactions
Correct: A (index 0)
Explanation: Layer 2 solutions scale by processing transactions off-chain or in batches, significantly reducing gas fees.

Q2: [Next question...]
```

3. Then convert to the code format above

### **Option 2: Use This Template**

Copy this template and fill it in:

```typescript
topic: "[YOUR TOPIC HERE]",

questions: [
  // Question 1
  {
    id: 1,
    question: "[Question 1 text?]",
    options: ["[Option A]", "[Option B]", "[Option C]", "[Option D]"],
    correct: [0-3],
    timeLimit: 45,
    explanation: "[Why this answer is correct]"
  },
  
  // Question 2
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "[Question 2 text?]",
    options: ["[Option A]", "[Option B]", "[Option C]", "[Option D]"],
    correct: [0-3],
    timeLimit: 45,
    explanation: "[Why this answer is correct]"
  },
  
  // ... Continue for questions 3-10
]
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Wrong `correct` index:**
   - ‚ùå `correct: 1` when answer is the 2nd option (should be `0`)
   - ‚úÖ Remember: Array index starts at 0

2. **Missing commas:**
   - ‚ùå `{ id: 1, ... }` `{ id: 2, ... }` (missing comma)
   - ‚úÖ `{ id: 1, ... },` `{ id: 2, ... },` (comma after each question)

3. **Wrong number of options:**
   - ‚ùå Only 3 options provided
   - ‚úÖ Must have exactly 4 options

4. **Syntax errors:**
   - ‚ùå Missing closing brackets `}`
   - ‚ùå Unclosed strings (missing quotes)
   - ‚úÖ Use a code editor with syntax highlighting

---

## üîß Testing Your Changes

After updating questions:

1. **Save the file** (`src/lib/weeklyQuiz.ts`)
2. **Check for errors:**
   - Look for red underlines in your editor
   - Check terminal/build output for TypeScript errors
3. **Test locally:**
   - Start the quiz in Weekly Quiz mode
   - Verify all 10 questions appear
   - Check that correct answers work
   - Confirm explanations display properly
